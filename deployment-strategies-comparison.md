# Kubernetes Deployment Strategies Comparison

This document provides a comprehensive comparison of the four deployment strategies implemented in this repository: Recreate, Rolling Update, Blue/Green, and Canary.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Recreate | Rolling Update | Blue/Green | Canary |
|---------|----------|---------------|------------|--------|
| **Downtime** | Yes (complete downtime during deployment) | No (zero downtime) | No (zero downtime) | No (zero downtime) |
| **Resource Usage** | Low (no extra resources needed) | Medium (slightly more during transition) | High (requires double resources) | Medium-High (requires resources for both versions) |
| **Rollback Speed** | Fast (single operation) | Medium (must roll back each pod) | Very Fast (just switch traffic) | Fast (redirect all traffic to stable version) |
| **Complexity** | Low (simplest approach) | Low-Medium | Medium-High | High |
| **Testing in Production** | No | Limited | Yes (can test before switching) | Yes (controlled exposure) |
| **Risk Level** | High (all-or-nothing) | Medium | Low | Very Low |
| **Traffic Control** | None | Limited | Complete switch | Fine-grained percentage control |
| **User Impact** | All users affected at once | Minimal impact, gradual | No impact if done correctly | Only affects subset of users |
| **Suitable For** | Development environments, non-critical applications | Most production workloads | Critical applications, major version changes | Feature testing, high-risk changes |
| **Implementation** | Simple `strategy: type: Recreate` | Default K8s strategy with configurable parameters | Requires separate deployments and service switching | Requires traffic splitting capability (Ingress/Service) |
| **Monitoring Requirements** | Basic | Moderate | Advanced | Very Advanced |
| **Automation Potential** | High | High | Medium | Medium-Low (requires more oversight) |
| **Production Readiness** | Not recommended | Good | Very Good | Excellent |
| **Gradual Rollout** | No | Yes | No (all at once after validation) | Yes (highly controlled) |

## Detailed Comparison

### Recreate Strategy

**How it works:**
- Terminates all existing pods before creating new ones
- Simple "all-or-nothing" approach

**Pros:**
- Simplest to implement
- Ensures clean state (no old code running)
- No version mixing
- Lower resource usage

**Cons:**
- Causes downtime
- High risk
- All users affected simultaneously

**Best for:**
- Development/testing environments
- Non-critical applications
- When clean state is required

---

### Rolling Update Strategy

**How it works:**
- Gradually replaces old pods with new ones
- Default strategy in Kubernetes
- Configurable parameters for max unavailable and max surge

**Pros:**
- Zero downtime
- Gradual rollout
- Built into Kubernetes
- Easy to implement

**Cons:**
- Both versions run simultaneously during transition
- Limited control over traffic routing
- Rollback requires cycling through pods again

**Best for:**
- Most production workloads
- Applications with backward compatible changes
- When simplicity is valued

---

### Blue/Green Deployment

**How it works:**
- Deploys new version alongside old version
- Tests new version before switching traffic
- Switches all traffic at once when ready

**Pros:**
- Zero downtime
- Easy and fast rollback
- Complete testing before exposure
- Clean separation between versions

**Cons:**
- Requires double the resources
- More complex to set up
- Requires service switching mechanism

**Best for:**
- Critical applications
- Major version changes
- When thorough testing is required before exposure
- When fast rollback capability is essential

---

### Canary Deployment

**How it works:**
- Deploys new version to a small subset of users
- Gradually increases traffic to new version
- Monitors for issues before full rollout

**Pros:**
- Lowest risk
- Fine-grained control over traffic
- Early issue detection with minimal impact
- Real user testing

**Cons:**
- Most complex to implement
- Requires traffic splitting capability
- Needs advanced monitoring
- Longer deployment time

**Best for:**
- High-risk changes
- Feature testing with real users
- Production environments with diverse user base
- When maximum caution is required

## Choosing the Right Strategy

The choice of deployment strategy depends on several factors:

1. **Application Criticality**: How important is uptime?
2. **Risk Tolerance**: How risky is the change?
3. **Resource Availability**: Can you afford double resources?
4. **Monitoring Capabilities**: Can you effectively monitor partial deployments?
5. **Release Frequency**: How often do you deploy?

For most production applications, Rolling Update provides a good balance of simplicity and availability. For critical applications or major changes, Blue/Green or Canary deployments offer additional safety at the cost of complexity and resources.

## Implementation in Kubernetes

Each strategy can be implemented in Kubernetes using different approaches:

- **Recreate**: Set `spec.strategy.type: Recreate` in Deployment
- **Rolling Update**: Set `spec.strategy.type: RollingUpdate` with desired parameters
- **Blue/Green**: Create separate Deployments and switch Service selector
- **Canary**: Use Ingress controllers with traffic splitting or multiple Deployments with label selectors

This repository contains practical examples of each strategy that you can use as a reference for your own implementations.
